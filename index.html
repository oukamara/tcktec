        <h2 data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1800" class="section-title">What is culture shock?</h2>
        <p id="para" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1800">When moving to an unfamiliar environment, one might experience confusion, anxiety, or discomfort. This is a normal process of adapting to a new culture you may not be experienced with. Culture shock can happen to anyone and can affect our emotional and mental well-being. Those who are not accustomed to culture shocks can find this process incredibly frustrating. It is completely normal to feel like this so it is important to understand what culture shock is and how to overcome it.</p>

                <h4>Honeymoon Stage</h4>
                <p>In this stage, people tend to feel more positive and confident. The exicement that comes with discovering different aspects of culture creates a comfortable environment for people as they have only seen a portion of the culture. Just visiting countries for a few days won't give you a big enough culture shock to fret over so this phase will eventually fade out on longer journeys.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="coffee">
                <h4>Frustration Stage</h4>
                <p>Up until this stage, people will start to feel more irritated or depressed. Adapting to a new culture is something that takes time, thus having these types of feelings is perfectly normal. Cultural differences like language, customs, norms, and environments can overwhelm an individual. Some may feel homesickness, fatigue, anger or feeling out of place.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="coffee">
                <h4>Adaption Stage</h4>
                <p>This stage is when people will gradually learn to adjust to their new environment. Familiarizing yourself in the new culture is a way to become more confident and able to understand societal norms. You may still experience negative feelings, but many find ways to cope with those emotions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="coffee">
                <h4>Acceptance Stage</h4>
                <p>After spending a large amount of time in said culture, one might be able to call it home. In this stage, people will learn how to accept themselves as a member of a culture. Surprises might not be so common anymore as you have learned what to expect and how to deal with it. You may still not understand certain aspects the culture you are in, but your current knowledge about it is enough in order to function and thrive.

            <div class="ad-card">
                <h4>Dealing with Bullies</h4>
                <p>You should never feel bad for being different. Others should not bully you if you are having a difficult time trying to adapt to a new environment. Some people might come across as offensive or rude despite their good intentions, so it is important to differenciate between bullying and curiousity. You will need a lot of patience in order to fully adapt to a new school atmosphere, so it is best to take your time. If you are getting teased or bullied then what you should do is report it to the teacher. If you don't feel comfortable talking to the teacher then you can ask your parent to tell the teacher. If they dont stop, then contact Svetlana Põdder, the school's psychiatrist.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ad-card">
                <h4>Find a Friend</h4>
                <p>The easiest way to integrate yourself at school is to make friends. Here in TEC, there are many students who are TCKs, including teachers. You may find it easier to talk and socialize with people who are in the same boat as you. Connecting through shared experiences is a great way to create a more fostering environment at school. Some people may also be interested in you, so take advantage of that opprtunity and bond through shared interests and hobbies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ad-card">
                <h4>Learning the Language</h4>
                <p>If you don't have experience with Estonian or a similar language, it will take a lot of patience to learn it. Estonian is one of the hardest languages to learn as an English speaker, so don't be discourage if you aren't good at it. You can find an Estonian friend to practice with, or start using Estonian out in public to gain confidence. There's many approaches to learning a language, so it is best to find a way you are comfortable with. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="ad-card">
                <h4>Be Open-Minded</h4>
                <p>You should always be open-minded to trying new things. Having an open mind allows you to understand with the culture more. It helps you to interact with others. If you happen to dislike certain aspects of the culture, you should still treat it with respect. For example, if you actively express your hatred towards traditional Estonian clothes, then you shouldn't expect people to respect your culture either.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="ad-card">
                <h4>Share your Expiriences with Family</h4>
                <p>Some members of your family might be worried about you living in a foreign country, so you should contact them and share your expiriences. Despite being far away from eachother, you can still maintain a good relationship with your family through social media. You can even vent your frustration to them if you are having a bad day.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="ad-card">
                <h4>Prioritize your Well-being</h4>
                <p>You might be too focused on school and fitting in that you place your well-being aside. Having both of your physical and mental well-being be in good shape is crucial in order to get over culture shock. Your negative feelings might overrun your mind and cause further harm to your well-being. Neglecting on self-care causes more harm than good.
